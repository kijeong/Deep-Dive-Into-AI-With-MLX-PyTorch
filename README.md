# Deep Dive into AI with MLX and PyTorch
![cover.png](images/cover.png)
"Deep Dive into AI with MLX and PyTorch" is an educational initiative designed to help anyone interested in AI, specifically in machine learning and deep learning, using Apple's MLX and Meta's PyTorch frameworks.

‼️**Important Note:** I have completed the three books on AI, MLX, and Math, as well as a plethora of in-depth analyses on AI papers. Due to the substantial size of the repository (7GB+), I have reinitialized it while preserving all current content except the old essays section. While I'm not actively adding new content, I am maintaining this repository for reference. I am focusing on new projects: an Illustrated Novel ["The Pippa Protocol"](https://github.com/neobundy/cwkThePippaProtocol) and a new repository ["C.W.K. Tech Guides"](https://github.com/neobundy/cwkGuides) for additional technical guides. I hope this repository has been helpful to you. Thank you for your support.

I stopped working on MLX projects due to the Metal bugs in MacOS. Here's the full story:

## Project Overview

The best way to grasp any concept is to articulate it in your own words, an approach I've actively practiced throughout my life. Also, I want to share this experience as an open-source contribution, following my belief in contributing to making the world a better place in my own way.

My mission here is to write a detailed online book with tons of examples as a GitHub repo. Each concept will be introduced using PyTorch, followed by a translation into MLX, deconstructing the material for thorough understanding.

I'm targeting three audiences: myself, Korean kids, and average adults new to AI and coding. I'll go into detail when needed. I'll also use simple English to help non-native speakers understand. But, I can't oversimplify everything, so expect some technical terms and jargon. I'll do my best to explain them. If there's something you don't get, try looking it up first before asking.

Everything, including the code and comments, will be in English. A good command of English is essential for understanding the code. It's an uncomfortable truth, but it's necessary. (To my fellow Koreans: Believe me, as someone who has been a lifelong resident and has learned everything in English throughout my life, I can confidently say that if I can do it, so can you. It's not just beneficial—it's crucial.)

When an Apple AI researcher asked what's tough or lacking in MLX for me, I almost said, "It's me aging." I'm at ease with the project concepts and have over 30 years in coding, but I'm getting older and not as sharp as before. So, I'm writing this book as if it's for me. Please bear with me.

Even with getting older, trust me, I'm still fast. So no dragging your feet. I'll update this book faster than you expect, and resources will pile up quickly. If you want to keep up, don't delay.

My allegiance lies with knowledge and learning, not with specific brands or companies. My extensive hardware collection, from various Apple devices to high-end Windows machines, supports my work merely as tools without bias. As an investor, I apply critical thinking indiscriminately.

So, please, don't label me as a fanboy of anything.

In conclusion, while all three books are comprehensive tomes, they are not categorized as 'for dummies' books. Don't remain clueless; make an effort to learn. 

## Rationale for MLX and PyTorch

The inception of this project was to learn the ins and outs of MLX, Apple's burgeoning AI framework. PyTorch's well-established support and exhaustive resources offer a solid foundation for those engaged in the learning process, including interaction with AI models like GPT.

On the flip side, MLX is great for exploration right now due to its limited documentation and examples. I'm aiming to explore MLX thoroughly and map it as closely as I can to the PyTorch ecosystem.

Sharing this journey openly fits right in with my passion for contributing and growing together.

## Why Not TensorFlow?

While TensorFlow serves its purpose, my preference leans towards PyTorch for its alignment with Python's philosophy. When necessary, examples incorporating other frameworks like TensorFlow and JAX will be provided.

## The Case Against Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are great for brainstorming, but they can make learning tricky, often giving just an illusion of understanding. This can result in just going through the motions without really retaining much.

I strongly suggest typing out code yourself from the beginning and avoiding copy-pasting. It really helps you engage with the material and understand it deeply.

## Pre-requisites

To get started, you should be comfortable reading Python code. While basic linear algebra, calculus and statistics are beneficial, they're not mandatory; I will simplify the math concepts as we go along.

Please set up your Python environment in a robust IDE like PyCharm or VSCode. 

Should you encounter any errors due to missing packages, install them with the following command:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that running MLX examples requires Apple Silicon hardware. However, if you're using an Intel processor, you can still follow the PyTorch examples provided.
